Heart, heart, heart of a lion, lion
Heart departed from my soul
Thanks to everyone who hates me, only makes me fit my role
I got orange juice and doobies
I'll be tourin' troops and groupies
Shed fire, vampire, diamonds, diamonds, I got rubies
I got pills in my smoothies
SBE, just some loonies
Move like gang, hit the scene with my trueies
Money, money in my bank account
You know I've gotta spend it all
